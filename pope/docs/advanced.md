# Advanced: Extending the Pope Agent

- **Add new emotes or animations** by placing GLB files in the `emotes/` directory and updating `pope-config.json`.
- **Integrate new AI models** by modifying `PopeAgent.mjs` and updating the backend logic.
- **Connect to new worlds** by changing the WebSocket URL or world configuration in `index.mjs`.
